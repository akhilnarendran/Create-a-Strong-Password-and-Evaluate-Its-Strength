Author: NARENDRAN PP
Date: 07-12-2025

1. INTRODUCTION

In today's digital landscape, password security remains a critical defense against unauthorized access. This report evaluates password strength using industry-standard tools, analyzes key findings, and provides actionable recommendations for creating secure passwords. The analysis focuses on five password types, tested across three platforms: NordPass, Kaspersky Password Checker, and PasswordMeter.



2. METHODOLOGY

Passwords Tested

The following passwords were selected to represent common patterns:

cat – Extremely weak (short, lowercase only)

hello123 – Weak (common word with numbers)

P@ssw0rd! – Moderate (leet-speak substitution)

CorrectHorseBatteryStaple – Strong (long passphrase)

J#b7R$pK9!Lm2@W5 – Very strong (fully random


TOOLS USED

NordPass Password Checker: Assesses breach exposure and crack time.

Kaspersky Password Checker: Measures entropy and resistance to brute-force attacks.

PasswordMeter: Scores passwords (0–100%) based on complexity rules.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




B. KEY OBSERVATIONS

Length Matters Most:

The passphrase CorrectHorseBatteryStaple (no symbols) outperformed P@ssw0rd! (with symbols) due to its length (25 characters vs. 9).

Recommendation: Prioritize passwords with 12+ characters, even if fewer symbols are used.

Randomness Enhances Security:

J#b7R$pK9!Lm2@W5 scored 100% on PasswordMeter due to unpredictable character mixing.

Trade-off: Hard to remember; best for password managers.

Short Passwords Fail Universally:

cat and hello123 were flagged as "instant" cracks by all tools.

Critical Takeaway: Avoid passwords under 8 characters, even with numbers.

Tool Discrepancies:

PasswordMeter penalized lack of symbols more harshly than Kaspersky (e.g., CorrectHorseBatteryStaple scored 85% vs. "Strong" on Kaspersky).

Implication: No single tool is perfect—use multiple checks.




4. Best Practices


Do’s

✔ Use Long Passphrases: Combine 3–4 random words (e.g., BlueCoffeeMug$42).
✔ Mix Character Types: Include uppercase, numbers, and symbols where possible.
✔ Leverage Password Managers: Generate/store complex passwords (e.g., Bitwarden, NordPass).

Don’ts

✖ Avoid Common Patterns: "Password123", "Qwerty", or sequential numbers.
✖ Never Reuse Passwords: Unique passwords per account prevent chain breaches.

Advanced Tips
Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Adds a second layer of security.

Monitor Breaches: Use Have I Been Pwned to check exposures.





5. Common Attacks & Mitigations


ATTACK TYPE	 	|		DESCRIPTION			 |	DEFENSE STRATEGY
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brute Force		|	Automated guessing of all combos	 |       Use long, random passwords (>12 chars)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Dictionary Attack	|	Targets common words/phrases	         |       Avoid real words; use passphrases
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Phishing		|	Tricks users into sharing logins	 |      Verify URLs; enable MFA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



6. Conclusion


This analysis confirms that password length and randomness are the most critical factors for security. While symbols and complexity help, a 20-character passphrase without symbols can be stronger than a 10-character password with symbols. For optimal security:

Adopt passphrases for memorability.

Use a password manager for fully random passwords.

Regularly audit passwords with strength-checking tools.

Final Recommendation: Update weak passwords immediately and enable MFA wherever possible.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




B. KEY OBSERVATIONS

Length Matters Most:

The passphrase CorrectHorseBatteryStaple (no symbols) outperformed P@ssw0rd! (with symbols) due to its length (25 characters vs. 9).

Recommendation: Prioritize passwords with 12+ characters, even if fewer symbols are used.

Randomness Enhances Security:

J#b7R$pK9!Lm2@W5 scored 100% on PasswordMeter due to unpredictable character mixing.

Trade-off: Hard to remember; best for password managers.

Short Passwords Fail Universally:

cat and hello123 were flagged as "instant" cracks by all tools.

Critical Takeaway: Avoid passwords under 8 characters, even with numbers.

Tool Discrepancies:

PasswordMeter penalized lack of symbols more harshly than Kaspersky (e.g., CorrectHorseBatteryStaple scored 85% vs. "Strong" on Kaspersky).

Implication: No single tool is perfect—use multiple checks.




4. Best Practices


Do’s

✔ Use Long Passphrases: Combine 3–4 random words (e.g., BlueCoffeeMug$42).
✔ Mix Character Types: Include uppercase, numbers, and symbols where possible.
✔ Leverage Password Managers: Generate/store complex passwords (e.g., Bitwarden, NordPass).

Don’ts

✖ Avoid Common Patterns: "Password123", "Qwerty", or sequential numbers.
✖ Never Reuse Passwords: Unique passwords per account prevent chain breaches.

Advanced Tips
Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Adds a second layer of security.

Monitor Breaches: Use Have I Been Pwned to check exposures.





5. Common Attacks & Mitigations


ATTACK TYPE	 	|		DESCRIPTION			 |	DEFENSE STRATEGY
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brute Force		|	Automated guessing of all combos	 |       Use long, random passwords (>12 chars)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Dictionary Attack	|	Targets common words/phrases	         |       Avoid real words; use passphrases
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Phishing		|	Tricks users into sharing logins	 |      Verify URLs; enable MFA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



6. Conclusion


This analysis confirms that password length and randomness are the most critical factors for security. While symbols and complexity help, a 20-character passphrase without symbols can be stronger than a 10-character password with symbols. For optimal security:

Adopt passphrases for memorability.

Use a password manager for fully random passwords.

Regularly audit passwords with strength-checking tools.

Final Recommendation: Update weak passwords immediately and enable MFA wherever possible.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




B. KEY OBSERVATIONS

Length Matters Most:

The passphrase CorrectHorseBatteryStaple (no symbols) outperformed P@ssw0rd! (with symbols) due to its length (25 characters vs. 9).

Recommendation: Prioritize passwords with 12+ characters, even if fewer symbols are used.

Randomness Enhances Security:

J#b7R$pK9!Lm2@W5 scored 100% on PasswordMeter due to unpredictable character mixing.

Trade-off: Hard to remember; best for password managers.

Short Passwords Fail Universally:

cat and hello123 were flagged as "instant" cracks by all tools.

Critical Takeaway: Avoid passwords under 8 characters, even with numbers.

Tool Discrepancies:

PasswordMeter penalized lack of symbols more harshly than Kaspersky (e.g., CorrectHorseBatteryStaple scored 85% vs. "Strong" on Kaspersky).

Implication: No single tool is perfect—use multiple checks.




4. Best Practices


Do’s

✔ Use Long Passphrases: Combine 3–4 random words (e.g., BlueCoffeeMug$42).
✔ Mix Character Types: Include uppercase, numbers, and symbols where possible.
✔ Leverage Password Managers: Generate/store complex passwords (e.g., Bitwarden, NordPass).

Don’ts

✖ Avoid Common Patterns: "Password123", "Qwerty", or sequential numbers.
✖ Never Reuse Passwords: Unique passwords per account prevent chain breaches.

Advanced Tips
Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Adds a second layer of security.

Monitor Breaches: Use Have I Been Pwned to check exposures.





5. Common Attacks & Mitigations


ATTACK TYPE	 	|		DESCRIPTION			 |	DEFENSE STRATEGY
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Brute Force		|	Automated guessing of all combos	 |       Use long, random passwords (>12 chars)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Dictionary Attack	|	Targets common words/phrases	         |       Avoid real words; use passphrases
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Phishing		|	Tricks users into sharing logins	 |      Verify URLs; enable MFA
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



6. Conclusion


This analysis confirms that password length and randomness are the most critical factors for security. While symbols and complexity help, a 20-character passphrase without symbols can be stronger than a 10-character password with symbols. For optimal security:

Adopt passphrases for memorability.

Use a password manager for fully random passwords.

Regularly audit passwords with strength-checking tools.

Final Recommendation: Update weak passwords immediately and enable MFA wherever possible.























PASSWORD SECURITY EVALUATION REPORT

Author: NARENDRAN PP
Date: 07-12-2025

1. INTRODUCTION

In today's digital landscape, password security remains a critical defense against unauthorized access. This report evaluates password strength using industry-standard tools, analyzes key findings, and provides actionable recommendations for creating secure passwords. The analysis focuses on five password types, tested across three platforms: NordPass, Kaspersky Password Checker, and PasswordMeter.



2. METHODOLOGY

Passwords Tested

The following passwords were selected to represent common patterns:

cat – Extremely weak (short, lowercase only)

hello123 – Weak (common word with numbers)

P@ssw0rd! – Moderate (leet-speak substitution)

CorrectHorseBatteryStaple – Strong (long passphrase)

J#b7R$pK9!Lm2@W5 – Very strong (fully random


TOOLS USED

NordPass Password Checker: Assesses breach exposure and crack time.

Kaspersky Password Checker: Measures entropy and resistance to brute-force attacks.

PasswordMeter: Scores passwords (0–100%) based on complexity rules.
